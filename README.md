# AES Implementation - CS1702 Network Security Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as part of the **CS1702 Network Security Assignment**. The project is written entirely in C and demonstrates encryption and decryption functionalities.

## Features

- **AES Encryption**: Secure your data using the AES algorithm.
- **AES Decryption**: Decrypt previously encrypted data.
- **Customizable Key Sizes**: Supports 256-bit AES key.
- **Educational Purpose**: Designed to showcase the workings of AES for learning and understanding network security concepts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code, you will need:

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC or Clang)
- A terminal or command line interface

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhinavparupati/aes-cs22b1041.git
   cd aes-cs22b1041
2. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc gmult.c aes.c main.c -o aes
4. Run the compiled program
   ```bash
   aes
6. Input the message to be encrypted and get the encrypted message and also decrypted message of Cipher text(encrypted message)
